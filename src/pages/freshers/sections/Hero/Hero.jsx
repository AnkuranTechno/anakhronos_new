            The transition from school to college life is a defining moment in
            every studentâ€™s life which further lays the foundation for his/her
            personality development. The cultural committee of Techno Main
            Saltlake has always been committed to giving these young minds a
            jump-start by providing them an incubating platform to showcase
            their skills. Freshers' welcome is one such platformthat encompasses
            a series of both on-stage & off-stage events which rightly boost the
            morale of the young participants by hosting them in a compassionate
            surrounding.
